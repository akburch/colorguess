# colorguess
Simple, interactive hexadecimal color guessing game made with CreateReactApp.

How to use:
  cd colorguess
  npm start

Notable features:
  Point counter stored in sessionStorage to save during game refreshes. The counter resets when the react session is restarted.
  
Future plans:
  Implement this in python so it launches a window with the same functionality.
